title: About

At the moment this is a staging ground to refine my thoughts. Some of my interests are niche, and my views unorthodox within those interests; I hope to reach people with enough common ground to critique me.

All successful systems start small and iterate to improve. This is the iterative improvement of the dissemination of my ideas. If you find a mistake or have a comment please don't hesitate to contact me.
