Twelve-tone Equal Temperament (TET) was invented to allow musicians to
play in arbitrary keys on a single instrument without retuning. In
particular this allowed musicians to perform pieces which visited
multiple different keys with only smaller temperament related tuning
compromises. However, computers have no limitations of needing to
retune, so there is no strong reason, other than traditions and
accustomed ears, to stick with TET in computer composed and generated
music. My (to be explained) hypothesis about the importance of IMD in
music theory predicts that a minor seventh chord should be the most
consonant tetrachord, but the minor seventh in question is not
particularly close to the TET minor seventh interval. Why not compose
on high level, the level of chord function, and translate down to
notes and frequencies only at the last possible step with as much
context as possible, then we can translate to more theoretically
optimal frequencies and not to the prescribed TET tones.
