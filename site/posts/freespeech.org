"Free speech doesn't mean speech free from consequences" the slogan
goes. But what is free speech if not speech free from consequences?
Free speech probably should not be construed as speech free from all
possible consequences, that is neither possible nor desirable, but it
must be construed as speech free from at least some sorts of
consequences. Perhaps free speech is speech free from coercive or
abusive consequences. The clear cut case of the applicability of free
speech is governmental restriction on speech; but governmental
restriction on free speech is nothing more than a set of consequences
for a speech act. So it is clear that free speech has something to do
with speech being free from consequences. The question that remains is
just what sort of consequences for speech violate freedom of speech,
and which sorts comport with it.
