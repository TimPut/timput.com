Epistemic thirst, as I use the term, is the drive to aquire information. The set of phenomena associated with it includes such things as curiosity and the drive behind scientific inquiry, but also ranges down to attention getting events (why does the attention-caught want to pay attention to that thing in particular), and even to why the typical state of a sighted animal is to have their eyes open. Why do animals hold themselves in conditions which cause them to receive information aobut their environment? It may seem common-sense, just obvious, that animals should do this; I believe this is an artifact of our thinking resulting from our condition as one variety of those information gathering animals. It seems the obvious thing to do because it is the thing that we do, and so it does not occur to us that it is a thing requiring explanation. These behavious are not random, they are not (in certain sense) accidental. They are complex, expensive behaviours which could only have come about through evolutionary means. To fully explain the evolutionary origins of epistemic thirst requires us to delve into the origins of thoughts; brains; and agent-hood itself, what it is for an entity to be capabale of 'doing somthing'.
