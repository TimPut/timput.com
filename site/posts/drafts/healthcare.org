Socialized healthcare is necessarily coercive. The only question is if that coercion be justified. Consider the fact that (for the moment) healthcare is administered by human healthcare professionals. The people must do work in order for a patient to be treated. In the simplest (and least practiced) form of socialized healthcare a healthcare professional would simply be forced to preform without compensation. This is trivially and obviously coercive. A generally more realistic model of socialized healthcare compensates the healthcare professional financially with government funds; and as the government is concieved of as a source of limitless, and morally unproblematic, funds, this is not commonly conceived of as coercive.
