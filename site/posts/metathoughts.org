        Writing on non-trivial subjects in a way which is of any use
to realistic prospective readers is difficult. There is a tricky
interplay between motivating the text with forward-looking glimpses of
the goal, and supporting the text with backward-looking logical
progression. There are difficult decisions of when to provide
background, and when to credit the reader's existing knowledge. 

Here I am going to collect my thoughts on how best to write for an
audience. Historically (term papers excluded) my writing has primarily
consisted of point form notes: sufficient information for me to
recreate my own thoughts and arguments at a later date, but not enough
for a reader to follow.

The ordering of the presentation of information and of the rendering
of arguments is particularly tricky. This is a common pattern I find
when I come to a new belief: 
- I'm considering a problem, something in need of explanation
- I note down features of the problem and set to work exploring
  possible explanations
- I discover an explanation for more general phenomena which includes
  the original phenomenon
When I go to relay a new argument to someone else I have to choose
between motivating the general phenomena, regurgitating the often
messy actual route I took to the argument, and building the argument
from the ground up, blind, with no motivation given.

It is common in mathematics to take this blind leading approach. You
are walked through various basic definitions and simple properties with
a lengthy build-up before being shown how to put those definitions to
use, and are then pleasantly surprised by the power of the simple
tools you were given. This has problems even in mathematics. It is an
extremely effective means to teach a mathematical theory. It is
probably necessary in order to speed the student through generations
of discoveries. Yet it doesn't teach much of anything about how to
approach new problems in math.

I'm tempted to suggest that what's needed is a small overview,
something like a table of contents for an argument, so that the reader
can see at a glance both where we're going and the general route we'll
take to get there. This suggests something like the structuring of
Wittgenstein's Tractatus, but that's famously unapproachable so maybe
I'm completely off track here.

I'll cut myself off here as my goal is very much not to blog about
blogging, and even less so to blog about this blog (a sin far too
common). To that end, any further thoughts on the subject will be
spliced in above without notice, and will not become new independent
posts.
