The empiricists are right; no direct access to the world as it is
exists. All information about the world is gleaned from interaction
with it and its inhabitants. This however, poses no problems. As the
Yoneda lemma shows us, all of an entity's properties are encapsulated
by its interactions with other entities. There is no way, not even in
principle, to distinguish between two objects, except by interacting
with them. Hence if two objects interface with the world identically,
then they are indistinguishable, and in particular, there is no means
by which to show that they are not equal. Liebniz equality for real
physical objects.

I would go further. Since the only way of gathering information about
the world is through interaction, it is incoherent to suppose that one
can refer to an "object" underlying a collection of interactions,
which exists as something more than the collection of those
interactions. Nothing beyond those interactions is even available for
reference.
