Include the following snippet in your configuration.nix:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
  systemd.user.services = {
    dailyalarm = {
      description = "Daily Alarm";
      path = [ pkgs.mpv pkgs.bash ]; #The service runs in it's own isolated environment, so we need to explicitly provide it with whatever the script will need, including a shell with which to run the script
      wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ]; #This ensures that the service is enabled at the end of boot up
      serviceConfig = { Type = "oneshot"; ExecStart = /home/tim/alarm.sh; }; #oneshot, roughly, means that systemd will do it's best to run the service, but if the time is missed, say because the computer was shutdown, it won't try at next boot until the time rolls around again.
      startAt = "*-*-* 6:30"; #Alarm runs every day at 6:30AM
      };
    };
#+END_SRC

Then put whatever you'd like your alarm to do in the referenced shell script. Here's mine:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
#! /usr/bin/env bash

mpv ~/summer.mp3
#+END_SRC
