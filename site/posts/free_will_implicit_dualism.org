It has become fashionable among philosophy of mind crowds to declare
the death of free will, often credited to some (erroneous)
interpretation of Libet's experiments. It is then claimed that this
demolition of the notion of free will threatens our dearly held
notions of responsibility for action. It is argued that since any
individual is, at least in part, the sum of numerous causal influences
which are undeniably outside that persons control: their genetic
inheritance, the happenstance of circumstance, et cetera; it follows
that that individual is not in fact responsible for their actions.

This is a peculiar dissection. It is put forth that the person inside
a body who performs actions is not really a person, but a mere
collection of accumulated causal influences. Yet, the person inside
the body which we might wish to hold, say criminally, responsible for
some action, is something more than a mere sum of causal influences,
is something with moral weight. This switch is undefended, not sharply
delineated, and indeed seemingly not even noticed.
